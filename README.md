# Project Overview

This is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. Uses [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application.

## How to run the application?

You can view the app [here](https://cwaku.github.io/Feed-Reader-Testing)

To run the application locally, clone or download the ZIP and then open `index.html` in your browser.
###### If feeds do not load and Jasmine says `No specs found`, that means your browser is thinking that the scripts are unsafe and thereby blocking the scripts from loading. You simply need to allow the browser to load the scripts.

## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!


## What i learned?

I learned how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.


## How will this help my career?

* Writing effective tests requires analyzing multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript - an extremely important skill when changing teams or joining a new company.
* Good tests give you the ability to quickly analyze whether new code breaks an existing feature within your codebase, without having to manually test all of the functionality.


# How I completed this project?

I started by reviewing the Feed Reader Testing [Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/3442558598/rubric)

1. I took the JavaScript Testing [course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud549) to get more fluent with it.
2. Downloaded the [required project assets](http://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader).
3. Reviewed the functionality of the application within your browser.
4. Explored the application's HTML (**./index.html**), CSS (**./css/style.css**) and JavaScript (**./js/app.js**) to gain an understanding of how it works.
5. I again explored the Jasmine spec file in **./jasmine/spec/feedreader.js** and review the [Jasmine documentation](http://jasmine.github.io).
6. I then started to write my tests for the application.
